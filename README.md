# TTG

This project now ships with a lightweight Pygame client offering a basic 2D
view and a small settings panel.  You can still run the original terminal
version using `main.py`, or try the graphical version via `main_pygame.py`.

```
python main_pygame.py
```

Follow the prompts to host or join a game.
